● KowAI Backend Layered Architecture Design

Architecture Overview

A secure, robust, and optimized backend built with FastAPI, Appwrite SDK, DSPy,
Prefect, SQLAlchemy, and Docker following Domain-Driven Design principles.

Core Technology Stack

- FastAPI: High-performance web framework for building APIs
- Appwrite SDK: Backend-as-a-Service for authentication and user management
- DSPy: Programming framework for AI agents and LLM optimization
- Prefect: Workflow orchestration for complex agentic workflows
- SQLAlchemy + Alembic: ORM and database migrations
- MariaDB: Primary database
- Docker: Containerization and deployment

Layered Architecture

1. Presentation Layer (FastAPI)

└── orchestration/ # Agent coordination

Key Features:

- Modular AI components with DSPy
- Complex workflow orchestration with Prefect
- Agent coordination and optimization
- Scalable AI pipeline execution

5. Data Access Layer

app/database/
├── models/ # SQLAlchemy models
├── repositories/ # Repository pattern
├── migrations/ # Alembic migrations
└── connection.py # Database connection

Responsibilities:

- Data persistence and retrieval
- Database transaction management
- Query optimization and caching
- Migration management

6. Infrastructure Layer

app/infrastructure/
├── appwrite/ # Appwrite SDK integration
├── storage/ # File storage services
├── external/ # External API integrations
└── monitoring/ # Health checks and metrics

Security Architecture

Authentication Flow

1. JWT Token Validation: Middleware validates tokens from Appwrite
2. User Context: Propagated through request scope
3. Session Management: Handled by Appwrite SDK
4. Token Refresh: Automatic refresh mechanism

Authorization Patterns

- Role-Based Access Control: Decorator-based permissions
- Resource-Based: Fine-grained access control
- Context-Aware: Dynamic authorization based on request context

Data Protection

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS and CSRF protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit

Logging & Monitoring

Structured Logging

# JSON-formatted logs with correlation IDs

{
"timestamp": "2025-01-08T10:30:00Z",
"level": "INFO",
"correlation_id": "req-123456",
"module": "chat.service",
"message": "Chat message processed",
"user_id": "user123",
"execution_time": 0.045
}

Monitoring Stack

- Health Checks: Endpoint monitoring
- Metrics: Prometheus-style metrics
- Tracing: Distributed request tracing
- Alerting: Critical error notifications

Docker Containerization

Multi-stage Dockerfile

# Build stage

FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Production stage

FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
COPY . .
RUN adduser --disabled-password --no-create-home appuser
USER appuser
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

Container Architecture

- FastAPI App: Main application container
- Prefect Worker: Workflow execution container
- Redis: Caching and message queue
- MariaDB: Database (development)
- Nginx: Load balancer and reverse proxy

Integration Patterns

Dependency Injection

from fastapi import Depends
from app.services.auth import AuthService
from app.infrastructure.appwrite import get_appwrite_client

async def get_auth_service(
appwrite_client = Depends(get_appwrite_client)
) -> AuthService:
return AuthService(appwrite_client)

DSPy Integration

import dspy
from app.ai.dspy.modules import ChatModule

class ChatService:
def **init**(self):
self.chat_module = ChatModule()

      async def process_message(self, message: str) -> str:
          return self.chat_module(message=message).response

Prefect Workflow

from prefect import flow, task
from app.ai.dspy.modules import AnalysisModule

@task
async def analyze_data(data: dict) -> dict:
analyzer = AnalysisModule()
return analyzer(data=data).analysis

@flow
async def complex_analysis_workflow(user_id: str, data: dict):
analysis = await analyze_data(data) # Additional workflow steps
return analysis

Performance Optimization

Database Optimization

- Connection pooling with SQLAlchemy
- Query optimization and indexing
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Database partitioning for large datasets

AI/Agent Performance

- DSPy model optimization and caching
- Async processing for AI operations
- Batch processing for multiple requests
- Model versioning and A/B testing

API Performance

- Response caching
- Pagination for large datasets
- Compression for API responses
- Load balancing and horizontal scaling

Error Handling & Resilience

Global Exception Handling

from fastapi import HTTPException
from app.core.exceptions import BaseException

@app.exception_handler(BaseException)
async def base_exception_handler(request, exc):
return JSONResponse(
status_code=exc.status_code,
content={"error": exc.message, "correlation_id": request.correlation_id}
)

Circuit Breaker Pattern

- External service failure protection
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation for AI services
- Health check integration

Testing Strategy

Test Structure

tests/
├── unit/ # Unit tests for each layer
├── integration/ # API integration tests
├── ai/ # AI module tests
├── workflows/ # Prefect workflow tests
└── fixtures/ # Test data and mocks

Key Testing Patterns

- Mock external services (Appwrite, AI models)
- Test database transactions
- Validate AI module signatures
- Performance testing for workflows

Deployment & DevOps

CI/CD Pipeline

1. Code Quality: Linting, formatting, security scanning
2. Testing: Unit, integration, and performance tests
3. Build: Docker image creation
4. Deploy: Container orchestration (Kubernetes/Docker Compose)
5. Monitor: Health checks and alerting

Environment Management

- Development, staging, and production environments
- Secret management with environment variables
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Database migration automation
